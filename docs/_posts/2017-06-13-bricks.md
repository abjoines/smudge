<!-- TC: Changes: changed most instances of API to PBR5 API; replaced instances of "texture" to "details" where most applicable; changed passive voice to active tone in some places. Reworded some passages to make it more concise. ("Don't Repeat Yourself.")-->

[Intro needs a little more reader orientation.]
[We need a name for this library that is better than PBR5, but thats what we have for now. I think "the PBR5 API" would be clearer than just "the API"]
[General note, what do you think of changing the tone to be more active? Instead of "the code was commented out" "I commented out the code"?]
[so texture is a "term of art" in 3D graphics. it means an image (usually loaded from disk) that is used to specify the pixel colors when geometry is drawn. I started changing the word "texture" to "details" in your description a bit, because I think that is clearer for people used to thinking of "textures" in a specific way.]


<!-- TC: What kind of a reader orientation do you think is needed here? -->

Building a brick texture as the first implementation of the pbr5 API was a good exploration of its potential as well as a good indication of other functions from which it would benefit.

At this stage in the API there were only two basic features: (1) the ability to describe a material with color, transparency, metallic, smoothness, and height, as well as (2) the ability to draw a rectangle.

```javascript
// describing a material with PBR channels
let exampleMaterial = new Material();
exampleMaterial.red = 1.0;
exampleMaterial.green = 0.0;
exampleMaterial.blue = 0.0;
exampleMaterial.transparency = 1.0;
exampleMaterial.height = 0.5;
exampleMaterial.metallic = 0.5;
exampleMaterial.smoothness = 0.25;

// drawing a rectangle
pbr.rect(10, 10, 100, 25, exampleMaterial);
```

These alone were the primary functions -- used along with pure javascript -- that were available to build the brick texture.

[Show the end result up front?]

The general process to set up the grid was as follows:
1. Establish the dimensions of each brick, as well as the space between them (the mortar). Define these as variables, so they can be changed later.
2. Loop through the canvas, and draw each brick —- using `pbr.rect()`—- at every x,y point of the start of a brick. Every other row I subtracted half the width of a brick from the x-start, alternating the grid and giving it more of an organic brick "feel". (in code, this means every other row starts at `x - brickWidth/2`).

At this stage, only two parts are being drawn: the canvas below the bricks (the mortar), as well as each brick. This translates into two materials. The canvas/mortar material (1) was initially given a grey-ish color, and a height of 0.1. The bricks material (2) was also a simple color and height, but the loop gave the opportunity to diversify the color of each brick. With a random function written outside the pbr function, a random variation of color was applied to each brick. (The albedo channel of the result is shown here.)

This brick texture is a good base, but needs some more detail and variety to be interesting. Observing the details of actual bricks, I took note of a few qualities as a guide to making them using the pbr5 library. Qualities include: color alteration within each brick, speckles on some, edge "noise" (bricks aren't usually perfect rectangles), surface flaws (randomized indents, roughness, etc).

For the first stab at making the brick details, I drew several randomly placed semi-transparent small rectangles within (above) each brick base (each one a relative of the brick base color). The result was a watercolory blend of colors on each brick. I added speckles by a similar process, whereby the material was a simple all-white semi-transparent material, applied randomly within/above each brick as 1x1 rects.

The first iteration had an issue: the mortar's height appeared higher than the bricks, even though the brick base was defined as higher than the mortar height. (shown here "Misstep 1").

The initial height of the bricks was correct, but was overwritten when the overlaid details were drawn. The embossing around the edges was the brick base height peaking out wherever a brick overlay was not drawn. The overlays were intended to change the color of the brick, but not the height. To fix this, I had to make sure the the overlay details were drawn with same height as the brick below.

For this example, it was possible to match the height of the overlays to the height of the bricks, but similar solutions won't always be possible. It would be better to just skip drawing to the height channel altogether. We plan on adding per-channel blending controls to allow just this.

Drawing the brick overlay details with the same height as the brick base fixed one issue, but caused the second misstep: the render lost its organic edge noise. Each brick—-although now appropriately protruding from the mortar—-was perfectly rectangle, which is unwanted for a realistic brick texture.

I came across the solution accidentally. I temporarily commented out the brick base, and bingo! organic brick-ish shapes beautified the canvas. In retrospect, the solution was to not draw the brick base at all, and only draw the brick overlays at the same height that each brick would be (perhaps with some variation). This ensured a nice rough border variation for each brick.

Considering the final version is built with just two basic library functions, I am impressed with the likeness of the end-result. The library already shows extensive potential beyond this.

<!-- TC: Different from the last of the three images above? -->


A few functions that would be useful for the future, as a reflection of some of the struggles as well as epiphanies of building the brick wall:
1. If there were some sort of "mask," it would have saved a lot of time calculating the areas on the canvas on which a brick was being drawn, so that some other details could be overlaid in the right place. Not only this, but a mask would allow for more complex shapes in the future.
2. In addition to the option to make materials, perhaps a library of pre-sketched textures would be useful to a user, assuming he/she gets control over some parameters. As an example, the "speckles" function was called several times over with slight modifications each time. Perhaps something like the speckles function, as well as the multicolor overlay that went over each for each brick, could become more universal.
3. In response to the misstep resulting in "negative bricks": perhaps there is a solution to deactivate some of the channels within each material (as an example: "material.height = undefined"). Either this, or to automatically build on top of a previous material without having to replicate its parameters. While this would surely make the library more intuitive, it's not as clear whether this would add functionality.
