.Print
    Finally, while digital screens cannot recreate qualities like smoothness and metallicness and height, it is somewhat possible to recreate these qualities in printed material using methods like selective gloss coating, foil stamping, and embossing. It might be interesting to use this system to create images wiht print in mind.

.Variety of Lighting
    [the effect is more pronouced when the object or lights are moving, or with more dramatic environments/lighting]
    [show different lighting? another post?]

. Inspiration
    This project builds on ideas from several other packages including Processing + p5.js, Substance Designer, and Unity.

    Processing—and its javascript cousin p5.js—is a creative coding library widely used by artists, designers, and students. I have used Processing in many of my creative coding classes


. Physically Based Rendering
    [this section may adjust based upon how much we suggest what pbr is up top]
    Most digital images, and most digital image authoring software and libraries, represent images as pixels that encode only the image’s color. These images and packages do not describe other properties of the image such as how shiny, metallic, or thick each pixel is. These material properties are important expressive aspects of traditional media image-making.

    Physically Based Rendering (PBR) is method of 3D rendering which seeks to simulate the real-world interactions of light and materials more accurately than previous rendering models. PBR materials use multiple images (maps) to represent material properties such as albedo (color), roughness, metallic response, emissive color, and height.

    Tools for creating and rendering PBR materials have become more widespread in the past few years. Unity 3D, a real-time engine used for game and interactive application development, introduced PBR support in 2015. Authoring packages such as Substance Designer, Substance Painter, and Quixel, allow artists to work with this more expressive representation of images using familiar tools. Combining this pipeline with VR enables powerful tools for creating virtual prototypes and material studies very quickly.
